    "philosophy-paragraph-1": "Scientific academic papers, also known as Primary Scientific Literature (PSLs), carry the most cutting-edge information in the scientific community and serve as the most direct and original scientific medium. While they are widely disseminated in professional research fields, they rarely directly enter the public science popularization and education domains. Therefore, the low prevalence of high school students' habit of reading scientific academic papers has become a social pain point that this project aims to address.",
    "philosophy-paragraph-2": "Through preliminary research, we found that the causes of this social pain point mainly include decreased paper readability, poor visual presentation effects, etc., among which the most influential is the lack of paper reading programs specifically designed for high school students with support for personalized user settings.",
    "philosophy-paragraph-3": "To solve the above problems, we decided to develop ANSAPRA, whose name is derived from the abbreviation of \"Adaptive Natural Science Academic Paper Reading Agent\". This project starts with natural science academic papers, linking to Nature and top SCI journals, which is of great significance for improving users' overall natural science literacy.",
